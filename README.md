# scholar
-----
just a small website without any design,
built for help people to add 'google scholar' search engine to the address bar of firefox browser.

to do this you need just visit this link: https://chaim-chv.github.io/scholar/
click on three vertical dots at the address bar, click "add search engine" and you can search in scholar right from the address bar, and even you can set it as default search engine as well.

hope you people are enjoy it and use it for good and spread knowledge in the world.
